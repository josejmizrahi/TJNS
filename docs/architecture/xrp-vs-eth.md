## Identity System Adaptation

### Identity Verification Flow
1. Registration and KYC
   - User submits identity documents
   - Platform verifies documents off-chain
   - Hash of documents stored on IPFS
   - IPFS hash recorded in XRPL metadata

2. Trust Line Authorization
   - Platform creates identity token issuer account
   - User creates trust line to issuer
   - Platform authorizes trust line after verification
   - Trust line status represents verification level

3. Identity Management
   - Revocation via trust line freeze
   - Updates through new trust line authorizations
   - Multi-factor auth using escrow conditions
   - Privacy controls via authorized-only access

### Technical Considerations
1. On-chain Verification
   - Limited to predefined transaction types
   - Complex logic requires external oracles
   - Simpler but more secure verification model
   - Built-in authorization controls

2. Self-custody Implementation
   - Users maintain own XRPL accounts
   - Platform acts as token issuer only
   - Trust lines provide verification status
   - Reduced smart contract complexity

3. Limitations and Solutions
   - No Turing-complete contracts
   - External services for complex logic
   - Oracle integration for updates
   - Hybrid on-chain/off-chain approach

## Token Economy Adaptation

### ShekelCoin Implementation
1. Token Issuance
   - Replace ERC-20 with XRPL trust lines
   - Enable Authorized Trust Lines for controlled distribution
   - Use 3-character currency code (e.g., "SHK")
   - Store token metadata in IPFS

2. User Flow Adaptation
   ```typescript
   // Current ERC-20 Flow
   getBalance(userId: string): Promise<Balance>;
   transfer(from: string, to: string, amount: number): Promise<Transaction>;
   
   // XRPL Adaptation
   // - Balance checked via trust line
   // - Transfers via Payment transaction
   // - Authorization via trust line settings
   ```

3. Reward System
   ```typescript
   // Current Flow
   awardTokens(userId: string, action: RewardAction): Promise<Reward>;
   getRewardHistory(userId: string): Promise<Reward[]>;
   
   // XRPL Adaptation
   // - Rewards via authorized payments
   // - History tracked through ledger
   // - Metadata stored in IPFS
   ```

### MitzvahPoints Integration
1. Trust Line Configuration
   - Separate currency code for MitzvahPoints
   - Required authorization for earning points
   - Freeze capability for compliance
   - Point expiration via time-based escrow

2. Point Distribution
   - Automated rewards through payments
   - Activity verification via oracles
   - Point burning mechanism
   - Transaction history tracking

3. Exchange Integration
   ```typescript
   // Current Flow
   getExchangeRate(): Promise<ExchangeRate>;
   convertTokens(amount: number, direction: ConversionDirection): Promise<Transaction>;
   
   // XRPL Adaptation
   // - Exchange via XRPL DEX
   // - Rates managed by AMM
   // - Conversions as atomic swaps
   ```
